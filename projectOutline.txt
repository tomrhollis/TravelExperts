Statement of Goals:
 The Travel Experts company needs to enter the online age. To get them there, we will create a functional website using their database where they can see the possibilities for their clients to navigate their product offerings, register, and place orders on one easy-to-use graphical interface.

List of Objectives:
 * Create a web-based user interface for clients to navigate and request products with 4 distinct pages for different business categories
 * Serve the webpage using an offsite server with 99.99% uptime
 * Import their existing database of clients, agents, and products to our server and display its information dynamically
 * Save customer input (registrations, vacation package purchases) in the database
 * Stretch Goal: Create a back-end web portal where the client can view all of their customers' input

 * For all: by December 6th

Assumptions:
 - The current hardware is out of date and the client will upgrade, but needs advice on how
 - The website will be hosted offsite
 - The current database already exists and is usable


Contingencies:
 - If the client prefers the website to be hosted onsite, the deadline date will be delayed until the hardware is upgraded properly
 - If the database is not usable, we will make simple and necessary changes to make it usable, but no more than that.

Scope:
 - In
    A functional website, on time
    Reporting, if allowed by time constraints
    We can provide 3 hours of consultation regarding hardware and referrals to technicians if necessary (billable)
 - Out
    Procurement and setup of new hardware
    Database cleanup or reorganization that don't affect website functionality
