* create login page - if successful send to register
* have it check for username exist
* dummy div on the right side of the navbar showing whether logged in or not

















1) Make sure the selected username doesn't exist --> XMLHTTPRequest (for now import all usernames into node at the start)

IN THE MIDDLE OF: getting it to call the request to get the username count. Getting node errors.



2) Login page - check if username exists & password is good. if so say hi & go back to packages. if not go to registration
3) format the data consistent with the database before insert
4) How easy are sessions?
   
5) bootstrapify

6) comments
